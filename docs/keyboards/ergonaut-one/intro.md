# Ergonaut One

Ergonaut One is an open-source ergonomic wireless split mechanical keyboard designed by Ergonaut Keyboards.

## Idea

We wanted to create a pretty affordable, nice looking, and, most importantly, very DIY-friendly ergonomic wireless split keyboard with Gateron Low Profile switches.

## Features

* Low-profile, which will reduce strain on your beautiful hands;
* Split. You can put keyboard where it'll be comfortable exactly for you;
* Wide availability and range of [compatible keycaps](../../switches/gateron-low-profile#keycaps-compatibility);
* Budget-friendly, because:
  * It uses relatively cheap and widely available [Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_BLE/) as MCU;
  * It uses one PCB design for both halves of the keyboard;
  * Everything except PCB's, components and hardware (screws, nuts) can be 3D printed.
* Beginner-friendly, because:
  * PCB is easy to solder;
  * Cases are easy to print.
* Wireless by design - no unnecessary wires, no unused connectors on the board;
* Free in terms of hardware design. It's licensed under permissive [CERN-OHL-P v2](https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_p_v2.pdf) license, which means:
  * you are free to manufacture it yourself;
  * you are free to sell your manufactured hardware for profit.

## Why Gateron Low Profile?

In 2023, choices were:

### Cherry MX styled

They are the most popular mechanical keyboard switches. They have an incredible amount of different switches for any keyboard enthusiast's taste. And insane amount of aftermarket keycaps as well. But it was not the best choice for us, because we wanted to create a low-profile keyboard, and MX-styled switches are very tall by design.

### Kailh Choc

This was our next obvious choice, since it's pretty popular among ergonomic keyboard communities. They are normal switches, but they some flaws:

* Lack of compatible keycaps;
* Low availability of keycaps;
* Tactile switches are mediocre at best (except [Sunset](https://lowprokb.ca/products/sunset-tactile-choc-switches) variant - they are pretty good);
* There are two standards for keycap sizes - 19x19mm and 18x17mm. Different keycaps are designed for different standards, which gives end-user unnecessary headaches while shopping for new keycaps.

### Gateron Low Profile (GLP)

This is a relatively new standard. First iteration (KS27) wasn't that great, but second (KS33) quickly caught our eyes. And it became clear that we really want to use them, because:

* Tactile switches are way better than most of the tactile Chocs;
* All GLP switches are pre-lubed from factory and buttery-smooth;
* They support wide variety of MX-styled keycaps;
* They use MX-styled springs, which means that you can easily swap out them and change switch weight;
* There is already a wide selection of [KS33 switches](../../switches/gateron-low-profile#ks-33-v2);
* They are only slightly taller than Chocs.

It's literally the best of two worlds! They are still low-profile, but have a lot of advantages of MX-styled switches.
