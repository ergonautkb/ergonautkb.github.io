# Ergonaut One Build Guide


## Assemble your PCB

| PCB                                 |
| ----------------------------------- |

You can assemble PCB in two different configurations - either with Xiao on "top", or on the "bottom". Pick a configuration based on the variant of the case you would want to use.

### Case compatibility

| Xiao position | Modern Case | Classic Case | FR4 Case |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Bottom        | ✅           | ❌            | ❌        |
| Top           | ❌           | ✅            | ✅        |

### Soldering

#### Xiao

1. Position Xiao in its designated place
2. Start by soldering two opposite pins
3. Solder the rest of the pins
4. Flip the board
5. Put some flux in the holes (marked by the red circle in the photo), and fill them with solder (you might want to heat those pins a little longer than usual)

#### Diodes

If you are building a "Bottom Xiao" configuration, diodes should be on the **SAME** side as Xiao.
If you are building a "Top Xiao" configuration, diodes should be on the **OPPOSITE** side from Xiao.

Please take note that diodes have polarity.

#### Hotswap Sockets

If you are building a "Bottom Xiao" configuration, sockets should be on the **SAME** side as Xiao.
If you are building a "Top Xiao" configuration, sockets should be on the **OPPOSITE** side from Xiao.

| Left                                  | Right                                 |

#### Power Switches

Power switches are always on the opposite side of Xiao.

### Verification 1

If you have a multimeter, test for shorts:

1. Between "-" and "+";
2. Between GND and 5V on the Xiao;
3. Between GND and 3V3 on the Xiao.

TODO: photos of relevant verification points

Then connect the battery, turn on the power switch and verify the voltage between GND and 3V3 is 3.3 volts.
If the voltage is not there, you probably need to re-solder the underside pads.

If you do not have a multimeter, just proceed with the instructions.

#### Batteries

You can choose any side for battery wires soldering, but I suggest using the same side as Xiao.

Please take note of battery polarity. Positive wire (red) should go to "+", negative wire (black) to "-".

### Clean up

Clean your PCB from flux residues. IPA (isopropyl alcohol) with Q-tips should do the trick.

### Flash firmware

Now it's a good time to flash firmware to a keyboard.

1. Download [firmware](https://github.com/ergonautkb/one-zmk-config/releases/latest/download/ergonaut_one_firmware.zip) and unzip it.
2. Repeat for each half:
   1. Connect the PCB to the PC via USB-C cable;
   2. Press the **RST** button twice - you should see a new USB device;
   3. Copy `ergonaut_one_left-seeeduino_xiao_ble-zmk.uf2` for left half or `ergonaut_one_right-seeeduino_xiao_ble-zmk.uf2` for right half to the new USB device. The device will disconnect automatically;
3. Turn ON both halves;
4. Press the **RST** button of both halves SIMULTANEOUSLY to pair them;
5. Try to connect it to the PC via Bluetooth and test that everything works;
6. Turn OFF both halves.

### Verification 2

If you do not have a multimeter, connect the battery on the left half and turn it on.
Verify it shows up as a Bluetooth keyboard.
If it does not and only shows up when connected to USB power, you probably need to re-solder the underside pads.
That is also the likely cause for the right half not connecting on battery and only working when connected to USB power.

After that, you can optionally verify the matrix.
Connect both halves to your PC and either use tweezers to short each socket or insert and press switches.

TODO: photo with tweezers

Keep in mind that some positions in the matrix are modifiers and will not do anything when pressed on their own.
A [keyboard tester website](https://www.keyboardtester.com) will work for modifiers, but it will not detect layers.

This step can be performed after assembling the top case, but before mounting the bottom.

## Assemble your case

Start by inserting the PCB inside the top part of the case.

Flip the keyboard, and insert some switches while holding the PCB against the top case. This will fix the PCB in place for further build.

Flip the keyboard again, and insert the bottom part of the case.

![](/img/one_build_guide/case/3.jpg)

Now the tricky part - you should place hex nuts in the hex slots on the bottom side of the case, and insert screws from the top side of the case.

**Note: please do not overtighten the screws!**

| Top                                  | Bottom                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |

Install rubber bump-ons on the bottom side of the case.

Now insert the rest of the switches into the case.

Now put your favorite keycaps, repeat the steps for the second half of the keyboard, turn it on, and enjoy your freshly assembled Ergonaut One!
