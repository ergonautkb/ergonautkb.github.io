<p>We're thrilled to announce the launch of the <a href="https://ergonautkb.com/docs/keyboards/ergonaut-one/intro/"><strong>Ergonaut One</strong></a>, a cutting-edge, open-source ergonomic wireless split mechanical keyboard that's been meticulously designed to transform the way you interact with your computer. Born from a passion for innovation and a commitment to comfort and functionality, the Ergonaut One is the latest creation from the forward-thinkers at Ergonaut Keyboards.</p>

<p>Our journey began with inspiration from notable projects like the <a href="https://github.com/foostan/crkbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Corne by foostan</em></a> and the <a href="https://github.com/yumagulovrn/dao-choc-ble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dao by yumagulovrn</em></a>. What set our hearts on fire was the idea of crafting a keyboard that didn't just look stunning but felt incredible to use. The goal was simple yet ambitious: to make an ergonomic wireless split keyboard that is affordable, visually appealing, and, above all, extremely DIY-friendly.</p>

<p>In the year 2023, we had options, but none shone brighter than the <a href="https://ergonautkb.com/docs/switches/gateron-low-profile/">Gateron Low Profile</a> (GLP) switches. With the release of the improved KS33 version, the choice was clear. They offer the best tactile experience, come pre-lubed for a buttery-smooth action, and they're compatible with a plethora of MX-styled keycaps. They're a breath of fresh air compared to Cherry MX styled and Kailh Choc switches, delivering a low-profile form without sacrificing the benefits of their MX-styled counterparts.</p>
