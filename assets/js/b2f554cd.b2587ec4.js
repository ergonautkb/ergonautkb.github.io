Born from a passion for innovation and a commitment to comfort and functionality, the Ergonaut One is the latest creation from the forward-thinkers at Ergonaut Keyboards.\\n\\n## The Genesis of Ergonomics and Aesthetics: Ergonaut One\\n\\nOur journey began with inspiration from notable projects like the [_Corne by foostan_](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) and the [_Dao by yumagulovrn_](https://github.com/yumagulovrn/dao-choc-ble). What set our hearts on fire was the idea of crafting a keyboard that didn\'t just look stunning but felt incredible to use. The goal was simple yet ambitious: to make an ergonomic wireless split keyboard that is affordable, visually appealing, and, above all, extremely DIY-friendly.\\n\\n### Unleashing the Features:\\n\\n- **Low-Profile Design**: Say goodbye to hand strain with our sleek low-profile Gateron switches.\\n- **Split Personality**: Customize your setup for the ultimate comfort with a split design that adapts to your workspace.\\n- **Endurance Champion**: A 250mAh battery ensures you enjoy up to a month of use between charges.\\n- **Keycap Versatility**: Express yourself with a wide range of compatible keycaps.\\n- **Wallet-Friendly**: Achieve ergonomic excellence without breaking the bank, thanks to the Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 MCU and a smart, one-PCB design.\\n- **3D Printed Customizability**: Apart from the PCB\'s, components, and hardware, personalize everything with your 3D printer.\\n- **Beginner-Friendly**: Easy-to-solder PCB and simple-to-print cases make this a perfect project for newcomers.\\n- **Wireless Freedom**: Enjoy a clutter-free desk with a design that cuts the cords.\\n- **Open Source Spirit**: Built on the CERN-OHL-P v2 license, empowering you to make it your own and even profit from your creations.\\n\\n## Why Gateron Low Profile?\\n\\nIn the year 2023, we had options, but none shone brighter than the [Gateron Low Profile](/docs/switches/gateron-low-profile) (GLP) switches. With the release of the improved KS33 version, the choice was clear. They offer the best tactile experience, come pre-lubed for a buttery-smooth action, and they\'re compatible with a plethora of MX-styled keycaps. They\'re a breath of fresh air compared to Cherry MX styled and Kailh Choc switches, delivering a low-profile form without sacrificing the benefits of their MX-styled counterparts.\\n\\n## More Than Just a Keyboard\\n\\nThe Ergonaut One is more than just a peripheral; it\'s a declaration that work and play can coexist on a foundation of ergonomic design and personal expression. Whether you\'re a programmer pounding out lines of code, a writer crafting your next novel, or a gamer on the quest for victory, the Ergonaut One is ready to be your trusty companion.\\n\\n### Ready to Join the Revolution?\\n\\nThe Ergonaut One isn\'t just another keyboard \u2014 it\'s a community project, a hobbyist\'s dream, and a statement piece for your desk. It\'s a testament to what happens when innovation meets the open-source ethos: a product that\'s accessible, customizable, and, most importantly, designed with your well-being in mind.\\n\\nKeep your eyes peeled for our launch promotions, and prepare to experience typing like never before. Embrace the comfort, style, and performance of the Ergonaut One \u2014 where your hands, your workspace, and your preferences are the priority.\\n\\nStay tuned, stay ergonomic, and remember: Your comfort is the key(board) to our success!"}]}')}}]);
